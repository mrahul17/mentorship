mentorship
==========

This is the portal for the Mentorship Program of IIT Kharagpur. This program is an initiative of Students' Alumni Cell, IIT Kharagpur.
 Students and alumni of a college will register for the Mentorship Program and fill in their preferences. Students will be shown a list of mentors that have similar interests. Through an extensive algorithm, the allocation of mentees to the mentors will be done automatically by the mentors. Also, the portal will send emails automatically.
 
 
 This project is aimed at reducing the tremendous amount of time and hardwork that need to be devoted for such a program for an institute like IIT Kharagpur. It is a free alternative to expensive mentorship portal providers( though currently it has only the basic features).
